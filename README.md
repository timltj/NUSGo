Team Members: Tan Eu Zin, Lim Tiang Jung Timothy

Project Level: Gemini

NUSGo is a Telegram Bot which aims to make commuting and navigating within NUS a simpler and faster process. Our bot provides students with a list of possible bus routes to choose from, by simply entering their starting location and destination through a series of commands. 

## User Stories
1. As a commuter in NUS, I want to have a full navigational path from my current location to my desired
location as well as an estimated commute time.

2. As a commuter in NUS, I want to be able to find the closest bus stop relative to my current position
upon query and get specific directions there.

3. As a commuter in NUS, I want to be able to see the next available bus timings of the nearest bus stop.

4. As an administrator of the system, I want to be able to feed in real time the GPS location of my user
and the real time bus arrival timings from NUSNextBus app.
